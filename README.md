## About
Konjour is a very lightweight, portable, and minimal C/C++ build system. Konjour was designed with the goal of allowing quick C/C++ project setup without needing to worry about learning the ins and outs of bigger and more complex build systems such as Cmake. Unlike Cmake or Premake, Konjour handles the entire compilation procedure, instead of relying on outside systems like Make or Visual Studio Solutions.

## Beta Roadmap
- [X] Multithreaded processing
- [ ] Interoperability with Cmake projects
- [X] Verbose error handling
- [X] Distinction between debug and release modes

## Current Issues
- [ ] 'Dodgy' code fixes
